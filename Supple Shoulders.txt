### Release Notes ###
#### 0.1 First Version ####
October 31, 2015  

* An incomplete draft
* Added the most common exercises I personally use in my routines  

### The Most Complex Joint ###
The shoulder is the most complex joint in the body because it has the greatest range of motion. With all that freedom of movement, however, it is also the most unstable joint in the body. All upper body strength and movement patterns stem from the soft tissues surrounding the shoulders.

### Commonly Used Tools ###
* Barbell
* Dowel
* Resistance Bands (Preferably rubber tubes for higher resistance)
* Single Lacrosse Ball
* 5-10 lbs weighted plates

### 1 Bent Arm Strength Exercises ###
#### Handstand Pushups ####
#### Rings Pushups ####
#### Dips ####
#### Pull-ups ####
#### Rope-climbs ####
#### Muscle-ups ####

### 2 Straight Arm Strength Excercises ###
#### Skin the Cat ####
#### Front Lever Pulls ####
#### Back Lever Pulls ####
#### Side Lever Pulls ####
#### Planche ####
#### Handstand Press ####

### 3 Mobility Excercises ###
#### Shoulder Dislocation ####
The most beneficial shoulder exercise. Start with a resistance band in front of you and lift it up and then backwards over your head. Rather than thinking of moving your hands back, think about rolling your shoulders forward first (i.e., inlocate). Bring the band back forward. Think about rolling your shoulders backward, then bring the arms around (i.e., dislocate). Perform end in sets of 10 repetitions, end of workout. Increase difficulty using dowel / weight dowel / barbell instead. A variation includes performing the motion lying chest to ground.

#### Scapula Push-ups ####
Push-up using muscles surrounding scapular muscles. Increase difficulty with resistance band.

#### Back-to-Wall Mobility Test ####
Back, shoulder, and head to the wall. Move arms up, and down keeping all points of contact to the wall.

#### External Rotation ####
Resistance band fixed on one end about chest height. Externally rotate shoulder pulling the other end of the resistance band with neutral spine. Focus the contracting the lats.

#### Shoulder Rotation ####
Use body weight or another person to apply pressure to shoulders when lying flat on your back. Rotate shoulders internally with 90 degree arm bend.

#### Shoulder Rotation under Pressure point ####
Postition lacrosse ball right above the insertion of your lat near your armpit. Rotate shoulders internally with 90 degree arm bend.

#### Straight Arm shoulder Manipulation ####
Lying chest to ground, lift small cans of food in each hand with thumbs pointing up.

#### Opening up the shoulders ####
Use resistance to open up the shoulders.

###  4 Hanging ###
#### Passive Dead Hang ####
Relax and open the shoulder. Hollow body.
#### Shrug Hang ####
From dead hang, bring shoulders down away from ears, and pinch the shoulder blades.
#### Arch Hang ####
Working towards shoulder strength in front lever. Lift the ribcage up.
#### Hanging Patterns ####
* Figure 8

### Release Notes ###
#### 0.1 First Version ####
October 31, 2015  

* Added the most common exercises I personally use in my routines  

### The Most Complex Joint ###
The shoulder is the most complex joint in the body because it has the greatest range of motion. With all that freedom of movement, however, it is also the most unstable joint in the body. All upper body strength and movement patterns stem from the soft tissues surrounding the shoulders.

### How to use ###
These exercises can be combined with your current program or be a standalone workout. Warm-up with relatively easy mobility movements every workout.

For a standalone workout, work 5 sets of 5-10 reps of 5 strength exercises (working both with pulling/pushing). Finish with 2 sets of 10 reps of 3 mobility exercises, and 2 sets of 10 reps of 1 hanging exercise. See section 6.1 for an example.

### Commonly Used Tools ###
* Barbell
* Dowel
* Resistance Bands (Preferably rubber tubes for higher resistance)
* Single Lacrosse Ball
* Double Lacrosse Ball
* Paralletts
* Stall Bars
* 5-10 lbs weighted plates
* Rings
* Parallel Bars

### 1.0 Bent Arm Strength Exercises ###
#### 1.1 Handstand Pushups ####
Perfect for those without barbell for shoulder press excercises. Work your way from headstand push-up to handstand push-up. Wall recommended for those who can't balance in a handstand yet.

#### 1.2 Rings Pushups ####
Hollow body, and don't let the lower back collapse. Full-range of motion is always recommended. Increase difficulty by widening the arm positions and increasing height of footing. Turn the rings out and lock out at the top (forces elbows to be straight).

#### 1.3 Dips ####
Full range of motion: shoulders are just above the bar when the body is lowered, and arms are locked out at the top. Increase difficulty by implementing variations: [Russian Dips](https://youtu.be/-J-1yLnvJLI), [Bulgarian Dips](https://youtu.be/9mKyrPmmPt0), Single Bar Dips, and [Korean Dips](https://youtu.be/L0mrC1c597c).

#### 1.4 Pull-ups ####
Maintain hollow body at all times. No arching of the back should be present throughout the movement. Pull-up to chest level.

### 3 Mobility Excercises ###
#### 3.1 Shoulder Dislocation ####
The most beneficial shoulder exercise. Start with a resistance band in front of you and lift it up and then backwards over your head. Rather than thinking of moving your hands back, think about rolling your shoulders forward first (i.e., inlocate). Bring the band back forward. Think about rolling your shoulders backward, then bring the arms around (i.e., dislocate). Perform end in sets of 10 repetitions, end of workout. Increase difficulty using dowel / weight dowel / barbell instead. A variation includes performing the motion lying chest to ground.

Resistance band fixed on one end about chest height. Externally rotate shoulder pulling the other end of the resistance band with neutral spine. Focus the contracting the lats.

#### 3.6 Shoulder Rotation ####
Use body weight or another person to apply pressure to shoulders when lying flat on your back. Rotate shoulders internally with 90 degree arm bend.

#### 3.7 Shoulder Rotation under Pressure point ####
Postition lacrosse ball right above the insertion of your lat near your armpit. Rotate shoulders internally with 90 degree arm bend.
